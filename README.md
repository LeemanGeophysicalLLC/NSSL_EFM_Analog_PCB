# NSSL Analog PCB

The analog charge amplifier performs the actual coulomb counting for the electric field  
measurement and filters the signal before passing it to the rotating electronics for  
digitization, synchronization, and logging. This board closely follows the design of  
the original instrument and includes a small microcontroller that allows temperature-  
independent control of the filter's cutoff frequency.

See the [main instrument repo](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/NSSL_EFM_Instrument)
for documentation and the rest of the instrument.
